2. Import the Java source files into the project.
3. Add the jars from "common-jars" folder to class path.
4. Add one of the "hbase-x.x.x-jars" to class path based on your HBase installation version.
5. Add the "log4j.properties" to class path.
6. Edit the "HbaseBenchmarking.java", and update the "hbaseConfiguration" variable to point to your HBase installation.
7. Create a "testtable" with column family "data" in your HBase installation.
